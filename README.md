# git-branches
Lightweight terminal app to scroll through your most recent git branches and check one out. It uses [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/), a Python TUI.

### Usage

I'd recommend creating an alias/function in your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc that executes the script in response to a command of your choosing. I personally like `gb`.
